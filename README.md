# **Applied-Statistical-Analysis**
I've done 4 assignments with **R** programming language during the course. Additionally, at the end of the course, I implemented the supervised algorithms in both regression and classification for the soccer analysis case study.
The main concepts that I've learned through the program are the items below.
1. **Data structures** in R
2. **Inferential statistics** with R (implementing parametric and non-parametric hypothesis test, confidence interval, p-value)
3. **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)** which deals with data manipulation with data frame structures and data visualization through various types of plots
4. **Supervised learning algorithms (Regression)** such as linear regression, polynomial linear regression, KNN, regression tree 
5. **Supervised learning algorithms (Classification)** such as logistic regression, polynomial linear regression, decision tree, LDA, QDA, Naive Bayes
